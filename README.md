# Take-home Assignment (Full Stack) #

### Goal: ###
* Create an Employee Table web application
* Use any front-end framework (Angular, React, Vue, etc...) or CSS library to accomplish this
* Implement the back-end API with the back-end framework of your choice, and a SQL database
* What we're looking for is your demonstration of best practices in terms of UI design, organization, code style, GIT commits, and documentation

### Functional Requirements: ###
* Initially, list all employees that are in data.json
    * First name, last name, department, and salary in currency format (i.e. $42,000)
* Implement the following CRUD operations
    * The ability to edit an employee
        * The department field must be a dropdown, with its values pulled from the database
    * The ability to delete an employee
    * The ability to create a new employee
    * Add validations as necessary

### Technical Guidelines: ###
* Structure your application and components in a modular/reusable way
* Commit code with useful and informative comments
* Your application doesn't have to use the data.json file directly, but have a SQL script to initialize your database with data found in that file
* Implement API code to read and write to a SQL database
* Styling: CSS or SCSS or SASS can be used, whichever you prefer (can use popular UI frameworks like Bootstrap as well)
* You can use any supporting libraries you'd like.
* You decide what's the best UI/UX. Use your imagination.
* While anything beyond the minimum requirements might impress us, make sure you complete the base requirements first, and deliver on time.
